# JCSimulator

## Outline

This is MMO Server/Client prototype system project. It is my first large scale server proejct. This project's goal is to build a server that can stand 1000 users. The world has a grid space of 10000 by 10000 in which users can interact with other users or game objects. I will also develop a virtual bot for testing.

The current game server is using a IOCP system, but will be added Linux's epoll. The future server will have a cross platform system. And I am not currently considering a database.
